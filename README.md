# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
### `Project Details`
## Live-Speech-Analyzer-Expert.AI ##

### Inspiration
I am working indigenously with Voice and Speech. I thought of implementing a live analysis of how we speak in a meeting, online. As the world is sitting badly at pandemic the only way we connect is online so the way we communicate is important. Hence, thought of a solution that helps to analyze the way you speak.
###  What it does
Our application checks on the way you speak in front of the computer and provide live analysis on the way we speak using expert.ai cloud api.
### What are the things it uses from Expert.AI
It uses
** NATURAL LANGUAGE API **
** Behaviour traits **
** Sentimental analysis(analyze)  **
** Disambguity **
** FullSentiment(Sentiment score also obtained) **
** PII **
** Writeprint  **
** Relations  **

### How it works
The Reactjs app uses web sppech to detect the speech as soon as we hit start button we can speak at Microphone using Speech to Text it converts the words we
utter into the phrases we obtain.
As soon we take a pause automatically speech recognition stops
Now we can analyse the phrase applying the expert.ai API with the buttons available.
To start speaking again we click on start button again and receive that microphone has started with on option.Currently Web Speech API supports different browsers.
## Usefulness
Understanding the way we speak
Useful in analysing the way we have communicated
The way we presented ourselves in Google meet
Very useful for Customer Call Center support to analyse the sentiments.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
